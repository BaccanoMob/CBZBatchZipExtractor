CBZBatchZipExtractor

Basically as name states its an app to zip folders to cbz/cbr files or extract them to folders.
This app uses https://github.com/tfussell/miniz-cpp library to compress/extract folder/file.

Technically, this only zips to cbz but so far renaming cbz to cbr has not gotten any issues for me.
If opening cbr files have any issues or errors, open an issue
