## CBZBatchZipExtractor

Basically as name states its an app to zip folders to cbz/cbr files or extract them to folders.
This app uses [miniz-cpp](https://github.com/tfussell/miniz-cpp) library to compress/extract folder/file.

I'm a novice to programming and github so my code my not be giving the best result. 
And technically, the app only zips to cbz not cbr but so far renaming cbz to cbr has not gotten any issues for me. 
If opening cbr files have any issues or errors, open an issue.

Single zip extraction or single folder zipping feature is currently not added (work around is move it to a new folder and use the new folder as directory).
I'll prolly add it in if I plan more features or change libraries (basically when I improve my programming skills).
